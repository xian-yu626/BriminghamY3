## Introduction
Air travel is a crucial mode of transportation for millions of people worldwide. Selecting the best airline is a significant decision that greatly impacts the overall travel experience. However, accessing comprehensive and understandable information to make an informed choice can be challenging. The Civil Aviation Administration (CAA) provides a vast amount of flight information on its official website, including departure and landing locations, flight delay times and proportions, compiled from statistical reports of various airports. Unfortunately, this valuable data is presented in CSV or PDF formats, making it cumbersome for users to sift through and interpret the large volume of information.
To address this challenge, the goal of this project was to create a flight data visualization web application that offers users an intuitive and insightful way to access key information such as flight delays and airline complaints. By presenting data through visually appealing and easy-to-understand visuals, the web app aims to help users choose the airline that best suits their travel needs.

## Features
1. Interactive Data Visualization: The web application provides interactive and dynamic visualizations to present flight data in an engaging manner.
2. Airline Delay Prediction: Machine learning algorithms are employed to predict airline delays based on historical data.
3. User Feedback Integration: The application allows users to provide feedback, which will be considered for further improvements.

## Technologies Used
The project utilizes cutting-edge technologies and frameworks for data processing, web visualization, and machine learning. The main technologies used include:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Echarts.js and Boostrap (for data visualization)
Back-end: Python
Machine Learning: LGBM
Database: PostgreSQL (for storing and managing data)
